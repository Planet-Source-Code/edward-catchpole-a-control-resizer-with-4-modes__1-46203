## A\+\+ Control Resizer with 4 modes\!


</div>

### Description

Simply and easily resize all the controls on any form by use of a reusable class. Set the different modes for the Left, Top, Width and Height properties of controls by entering 4 numbers into their Tag property (a number for Left, a number for Top, a number for Width and a number for Height). There are 4 different modes: Do nothing: the resize code wont touch properties with this mode. Proportional: control property will be resized according to the forms change. Static change: the control property will move with the form. Limited static change: if the form is made too small then the control wont go off the screen (still in testing stage). For example; a label with a tag of '0011' will not change its left or top property, and the width and height will change proportionally. The next release will be even more improved with the Limited Static Change fully tested and an add-in to easily configure tag properties. Please vote and leave constructive critisism.
